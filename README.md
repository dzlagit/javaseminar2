Work from Java seminars w/c 09/10/2023

## **Exercise 2** = 
Using the Java you have learned in the first 3 lectures write a program to ask a user for 2 numbers (use the Scanner class) and print out the sum of the two numbers. Place breakpoints in your code and look at how your variables behave.


## **Exercise 3** = 
A shipping company uses the following logic to calculate the cost of sending a package:

£2.50 if the package weights more than 0 and is less than 2 kg.
£4.50 if the package weighs 2 or more kg but is less than 4 kg.
£7.50 if the package weighs 4 or more kg but is less than 10 kg.
£10.50 if the package weighs 10 or more kg but is less than 20 kg.

Write a short program that will prompt a user for an input weight and output a price.

## **Exercise 4** =
Write a short program that prompts a user for a character (in the ASCII character set) and outputs its (decimal) ascii code. A run could look like the following:

Enter a character: E.                                                 
The ASCII code for character E is 69 

## **Exercise 5** = 
Write a program that prompts the user to enter 2 character strings (no gaps; the first long and the second short).
Your program should tell the user if the short string is a substring of the long string.

## **Exercise 6** = 
Using Java’s math class write a program that prompts a user for the length of a side and outputs the area of such a hexagon.
